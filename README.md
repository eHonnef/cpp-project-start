# C++ Project starter - Header only version

## Usage

In short:

- Change the project and namespace name
- Change the `code/include` and `code/src` folder structure so it accomodates your code, maybe you need to change the file extensions in "Locate files" section.
- Change the `app` with the main file, you can add more than one main file, just add another target in the `app/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Be aware that you need to set the 3rd party depencies public or as an interface because it will not be compiled by this project, unless you change it for a static lib.
