# C++ Project starter

## Usage

In short:

- Change the project and namespace name
- Change the `code/include` and `code/src` folder structure so it accomodates your code, maybe you need to change the file extensions in "Locate files" section.
- Change the `app` with the main file, you can add more than one main file, just add another target in the `app/CMakeLists.txt`.
- For header only check the branch `header-only`.
